    "## What are statistical tests ?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* A statistical test provides a mechanism for making quantitative decisions about a process or processes. The intent is to determine whether there is enough evidence to \"reject\" a conjecture or hypothesis about the process. The conjecture is called the null hypothesis. Not rejecting may be a good result if we want to continue to act as if we \"believe\" the null hypothesis is true. Or it may be a disappointing result, possibly indicating we may not yet have enough data to \"prove\" something by rejecting the null hypothesis.\n",

    "* __Spearman Correlation:Tests for the strength of the association between two ordinal variables (does not rely on the assumption of normally distributed data)__\n",
    "* __Chi-Square:Tests for the strength of the association between two categorical variables__\n",
    "* __Paired T-Test:Tests for the difference between two variables from the same population (e.g., a pre- and posttest score)__\n",
    "* __ANOVA:Tests for the difference between group means after any other variance in the outcome variable is accounted for (e.g., controlling for income, or age)__\n",
