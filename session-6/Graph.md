* * _In graph theory, an adjacency matrix is a dense way of describing the finite graph structure. It is the 2D matrix that is used to map the association between the graph nodes_

   _adjacency matrix represntatian_

 # 2- *_adjacency list_*
 
 _An adjacency list is used in the linked representation to store the Graph in the computer's memory. It is efficient in terms of storage as we only have to store the values for edges._
